## Working with SAIL Data

Our research often involves working with the SAIL databank, which hosts anonymised population-level data for Wales. While the data itself is not publicly available, our algorithms and code are open-source and can be adapted for use with other datasets.

If you are interested in accessing SAIL data:
- Visit the [SAIL website](https://saildatabank.com/) for more information.
- Contact the SAIL team to request access and permissions.

## Code Style and Standards

To maintain consistency across our projects, please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Include comments and docstrings to explain complex logic.
- Write unit tests for new functionality.
- Ensure your code is linted and formatted using tools like `black` and `flake8`.
